# About Homebrew Character Builder App
The Homebrew Character Builder App is built with Django and styled with SASS.

This app displays user made characters for Dungeons and Dragons or Pathfinder. Characters can have a photo if using an image url. Each character is in further detail on a Detail page and shows all the specific stats of a character. Each Detail page allows the Characters Creator to update and delete their character.

The live version of this app can be viewed [here](https://homebrew-character-builder.herokuapp.com/).
